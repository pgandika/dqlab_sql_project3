						<p><br>the number of customers who have made transactions has decreased from 1st quarter to 2nd quarter. In 1st quarter, customers who have made transactions are around 58% of total customers registered in 1st quarter and in 2nd quarter, customers who have made transactions are about 54% of total registered customers in 2nd quarter. The total number of new customers who have ordered is only about 56%.</p>

						<p>customers who have made transactions in 1st quarter and returned to transactions in 2nd quarter are 24%.</p>

						<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
						<p>Based on the data that we have obtained through SQL queries, we can conclude that:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>xyz.com's performance decreased significantly in the 2nd quarter, as seen from the value of sales and revenue which dropped by 20% and 24%,</li>
							<li>the acquisition of new customers is also not very good, and slightly decreased compared to the previous quarter.</li>
							<li>The interest of new customers to shop at xyz.com is still lacking, only about 56% have made transactions. It is recommended that the Product team need to study customer behavior and make product improvements, so that the conversion rate (register to transaction) can increase.</li>
							<li>Product categories S18 and S24 contribute about 50% of total orders and 60% of total sales, so xyz.com should focus on developing categories S18 and S24.</li>
							<li>xyz.com's customer retention rate is also very low at only 24%, meaning that many customers who have transacted in the 1st quarter do not return to order in the 2nd quarter (no repeat orders).</li>
							<li>xyz.com experienced negative growth in the 2nd quarter and needs to make a lot of improvements both in terms of products and marketing business, if you want to achieve the target and have positive growth in the 3rd quarter. The low retention rate and conversion rate can be an early diagnosis that customers are not interested/unsatisfied/disappointed in shopping at xyz.com.</li>
